# Foundation...
The infrustructure that supports all activities within procurement.

- **Single point of entry**
	- Where people's experience starts, and it's what connects all the experiences across procurement activity.
- **Knowledge management and support desk**
	- Access to support, learning, help, and continous feedback. Employee support.
- **Adopting a service mentality**
	- Service mentality. What does procurement look like as a service to the rest of the organisation. Where our customers or our users are Origin staff.


So let's check out the single point of entry.

--------

**How do we do this, what are our proposed steps**
- Go and build a landing page in the appropriate medium of choice.
- Defining what an Minimam Viable Product of how this page could operate and what it would connect with.
- How it would interact with employees / where it would live in their existing platforms. (We've explored systems such as serviceNow.)

So that's our single point of entry.

Next we're going to take a look at touchless sourcing.

**Touchless sourcing is (read)**

- So business activity occurs... and procurent activity happens. 
- You could think of this as moving down in the pyramid  that angel showed earlier that we're moving towards.

So what are our proposed inititatives?

We have two. Firstly:
- automated on / offboarding which we will get into. This is the idea of business activity triggering souricng / buying.
- The next is an automated sales order to PO creation
	- This is the idea of a PO automatically being generated based on someone making a sales order.
	- This has a lot of potential to reduce manual effort and time required from stakeholders.

Lets look at automated on / off boarding

## Guided Buying

So I'm sure guided buying is quite familiar to us. We've defined this pillar as: (read)

Again this is shifting to that lower touch area in the triangle.

- Example on catalogues.
	- So this is a recommendations to move to catalogues and punch outs as much as possible to reduce manual efforts.
- Maintain hosted catalogue prices.
	- This is where we have an internally hosted catalogue, we've presented a few strategies to maintain reliability and reduce the risk of redundancy in these internally hosted catalogeus.
- Shopping cart experience
	- We've described that.
- Access to makretplace for non-catalogued items.
	- Ideally we have everything on hosted off contracts, in this case, for those items or those spot buys that are not hosted, we have the opportunities to access catalogues through things like AWS marketplace.
	- Currently only 5% of procurement is done through catalogues... %93 SAP says.

So.. How have we described the shopping cart experience.

- Data
	- Self serve capabilities.
		- Up to 2.3x more capability.
		- PR More PR generation.
		- Maveric spend.

**Facilitator notes:**

> these three buckets represent the different types of actions we can take off the back of the initiatives. Embark on being something that we can pretty much implement.


Let's chat and register our interest for where we feel these initiatives may sit within these categories.

Embark on, Develop, Explore. (explain what they are)

I don't really want you to think of this as a prioritisation, but it kind of is a prioritisation...

You can think of these categories as actions for we believe theses initiatives are capable of going /  What they are ready for?

So... I think we should timebox this as it could go on for a bit... it's just to get a feel for things

Let's start with 1.1:
And I'm actually going to pick someone... (x)... where do you think this sits?
