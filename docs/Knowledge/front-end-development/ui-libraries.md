# UI Libraries

In front end development, there are three main approaches to building libraries.

1. Extensions of CSS (SASS, Less, Tailwind CSS)
   You can think of this as CSS but just a little bit more.
2. Behaviour Libraries (HeadlessUI, Radix, React Aria)
   Thinks that include functionality. Such as button focus, dropdown behviours.
3. Style Systems (TailwindUI, Bootstrap DaisyUI, Mantine)
   Compontent systems that are applied and integrated into your DOM.
   Often style systems such as Bootstrap are known as opinionated libraries. If you plan to customise the styling outside of their premade compontents, you are going to have a bad time.

Some solutions bridge across these three categories.
Tailwind UI, is a style system, that utilises TailwindCSS's styles. 

A component library lives in the space between a behavioural libary, and a style system.
