# Semantics should come as a secondary

Semantics in design refers to the meaning behind graphic elements, such as colors, shapes, and typefaces. It is the study of how those elements are combined and interpreted to convey a message. Semantics in design helps to create a visual hierarchy and effectively communicates the intended message to the target audience.

Semantics in button design refers to the meaning that a button conveys to a user. This includes the text used, the color of the button, and any other visual elements used to indicate the purpose of the button. Semantics in button design should be used to clearly communicate the action that will take place when a user clicks the button.
