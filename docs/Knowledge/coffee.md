# Coffee

Since moving to Sydney, I've missed the culture that surrounds the coffee seen in Melbourne, this led me to seek out ways to become more involved in Coffee.

Starting with experimenting with an [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com), then moving onto getting a [Hario V60](https://global.hario.com/product/coffee/dripper/VD.html), I soon learned about the world of coffee geekiness that was emerging infront of me.

Many humans of the world rely on coffee throughout their day, but their very disconnected from the journey that this coffee has gone through to arrive in their cup.

It excites me to speak to people that appreiciate the journey that these beans go through, and it excites me when people support ethical growers and roasters of coffee.
