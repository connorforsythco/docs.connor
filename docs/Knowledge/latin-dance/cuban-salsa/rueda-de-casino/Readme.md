# Rueda De Casino

In 2019, my goal for 2020 was to be able to lead a Rueda by the end of 2020, unfortunately for the pandemic, I was unable to dance throughout the entire year. Fortunately, I was able to spend 2020 doing other things that I am grateful for.

**Rueda De Casino** loosely translates in english to 'Wheel of Casino', it's meaning is simply to dance around a circle. 

Most of my learnings of Rueda comes from a dance studio in Melbourne called [Acontra](https://www.facebook.com/casineros/) on Lygon Street, as well as the iconic [Rueda in the Park](https://www.facebook.com/groups/salsainthepark) group. I Highly recommend people visit both of these locations.

## Tips on Calling Ruedas
Calling a Rueda for the first time can be a little daunting, but we are delighted that so many are taking on the challenge and wanting to practice the art. There are those “callers” who are just naturals, like they were born to do this and only this. They seem to command the rueda so effortlessly, that you’d almost think it was a piece of cake… unless you have done it yourself! For most though, and especially if you don’t speak Spanish, calling can be a bit tricky at first, but it’s not to say you shouldn’t give it a try.

I’ve made a list of tips that I hope will help you get started. These are really based on my own experience, so anyone out there with other tips, please feel free to comment!

I hope you find them useful, and put them in practice when you come to the park next time!

### Smile
More than anything, I think this should be the most important tip when calling a rueda. When you dance salsa with only one partner, you can already feel the energy building up because the two of you are feeding off each other. When you are in a rueda, the energy is amplified because you are dancing with so many other people. But the most important source of energy is the caller – imagine what would happen if a caller was quiet, serious, lazy and looked PO? Would you want to dance in that kind of rueda? You’ll be amazed how quickly people respond to a caller that is smiling and happy. So don’t forget, smile, smile and smile! Even if you mess the call up, don’t worry just keep smiling and call DAME! Remember, it’s supposed to be fun, so have fun calling too!

### Articulate and enunciate
Some people think that you need to have a big voice to call a rueda. Ok, so it helps, I won’t lie… But I’ve also experienced dancing rueda with one of the loudest callers ever, and guess what? Nobody could understand a word he was saying, and that’s even when most of the people dancing could speak Spanish! The best callers are those that clearly enunciate and articulate. Sometimes, in crowded dance floors, you don’t even have to pronounce anything (who’s going to hear you anyway?) and you can just use your lips - if you articulate well, most people will at least know the main calls like sombrero, enchufa, prima, etc.
 
### Get the timing right
Easier said than done! Getting the timing right is always difficult at first. Call on 1? Call on 5? Before DQN, after enchufa? Yeap, all very confusing. In fact, since I’ve never been good with counting 1-8, I have a little trick that can work for men and women. When you are doing Guapea (that’s the Cuban basic open step) call it like this:
Stepping inside the circle (towards your partner, on 5) – All moves that start with Enchufa, Prima, Candado (double handed enchufa), El Uno, Kentucky 

Stepping outside the circle (on the back rock, on 1): Dame and all moves that start with Sombrero, Setenta, Vacila, Siete

Problem is, when you start calling, you forget which one is which. When I started calling ruedas, I started by calling a rueda with only dames, enchufas and primas. Then I branched out and started calling variations of enchufas, primas and dames,  and then when I felt comfortable with that, I slowly started adding the sombrero calls, and so on. It took a while, but I got the hang of it… and yes, you’ve guessed, it was never natural, despite speaking the language!
 
### Think, call, dance
You know and realise soon enough that it’s nice to give everyone a bit of “head notice” – By giving everyone a 4-count head start, you can then make sure everyone starts the move at the same time. Try not to call the move as you have already started doing it. This does take a bit of practice, but it won’t take long before you get the hang of it, so don’t stress out if it doesn’t happen naturally at first.
 
### Use gestures and hands… or not
Most common figures have a hand signal that helps a lot when you are in a crowded noisy area. You can familiarise yourself with this, and it does help for others to understand you and follow up better, but if it’s just going to stress you out, don’t worry about it!
 
### Call for everyone, not just your partner
Most first-time callers forget that they are calling for everyone in the rueda, and tend to look only at their partner when  they call a move. Remember that, if the rueda is large, there may be people behind you that can’t see you, so by calling “into the rueda” and looking at all other dancers as you call, also helps in keeping people connected and engaged. Remember, you are dancing with everyone, and everyone is dancing with you!
 
### Make sure everyone’s on the right step
One common mistake is to start calling when some people are on a different beat. It’s important that everyone is in sync before calling a new move, and especially if you are calling several moves in a row. It doesn’t hurt to take a couple of seconds to scan the rueda and make sure everyone is stepping in and out at the same time. You can call “suena” or “foto” to help everyone get back on the beat.
 
### Be assertive
When you call a rueda, whether you’re loud, soft-spoken, nervous or hung-over … the best advice is that once you decide what you are going to call, don’t change your mind. Just go with your gut, say once clearly, repeat it if you want, but don’t falter. Assert yourself and don’t be surprised if people actually follow and do your call! Remember you are the boss and in this case, you should be bossy!
 
### Know the “wild card” calls
Dames, enchufas and primas should be your basic calls. So, when your mind goes blank, just think of those. Why? Because a) they involve a change or partner, b) everyone knows them, c) they all have variations, so when you call them, you might get inspired for the next call.
 
### Think of a fun sequence
You know, you’ve hear it, you’ve dance it! Every caller has their own little sequences that they like to call. Mine? I love the enchufa for arriba followed by dame dos and prima. It just feels good to me, and I love calling it. Memorising your favourite sequences actually also takes the stress off for a while, as you know the next 2 or 3 calls, and have time to actually enjoy the dancing! It’s very useful when you start calling, as you get more practice, alter the sequence a bit and see what happens!
 
### Know at least one long call
My long call I mean, for example setentas or balseros. When your mind goes blank, these calls give you a bit of time to think about your next call.
 
### Respect the level
Ahh… so here is a funny one – If you start a rueda with intermediate dancers and beginners join in, should you bring the level down? My answer is… yes, especially at the park, where it is about having fun and about everyone being able to jump in. On the dance floor, dancers should first look at the level before jumping in to a rueda, but that hardly happens does it? My advice (and this is of course, only my advice), throw in a couple of new moves or more difficult moves if you want, try it a couple of times if you want to give everyone the chance to get it right, but if it’s not working after 2 or 3 tries, you’ll be putting some people in an embarrassing situation, and also disrupting the flow of the rueda for the other dancers. Try to keep a balance and make sure that everyone in the rueda is actually having fun.  There are plenty plenty of other moves you can chose from, and a rueda is not about how many moves you can fit into a song, but sometimes the best ruedas can be the ones that flow and that are kept basic. After the song, you can always go up to the other dancer and go over the move so they can learn it.
 
### Practice Makes Perfect
It’s really all about having fun, and you can only get better with practice. Try practicing in small ruedas (2 or 3 couples) and see how you go. Or alternate with another caller for the same song… most of all, give it try, and see if you like it. But most of all, keep coming to the park so you can practice and dance with us all!
Happy ruedas to y’all! See you soon at the park!
