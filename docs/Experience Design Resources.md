# Courses

## University

It is likely that these courses may change by the time you get to studying them.

If I wanted to go straight into design/innovation in my undergraduate degree. I'd look at going to either RMIT, Swinburne University or UNSW or the University of Sydney. UTS courses are looking really great too. I've heard very good things. Design / Innovation is quite flexible though. The must do's are read the books, try the processes through whatever projects your working and reflect on your work.

**Melbourne**

**Overseas**

If Overseas study is on the cards, it's a great option. I'd recommend checking out the Stanford d.school. There are also some amazing places in Europe for innovation design. Get googling and make it happen! 

## Shorter, Specialised Courses

### Paid Courses

**[Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/?fbclid=IwAR1o6jYmgx0J118grbwFEB8VRM2l8F34h10iYLNL6RlhQGJOkCkqT95ZJY8)** (Basically a Netflix Subscription for UX Design Courses)

A bit of a one-stop-shop for easy access to design thinking practices. It's really easy to jump on and do some learning whenever you feel. It has beginner to more advanced courses that you can complete at your own pace. There's a good community on there with mentors too if that interests you. You also get LinkedIn certifications.
